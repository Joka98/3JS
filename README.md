The easiest way to run this code is just to open in in the VS Code and use the extension "Live Server" and it will open a port on your machine (usually for me its 5500).

You can see the port in this icon

if it doesn't open automaticly.

On your browser you can type "http://127.0.0.1:5500/" on the url.

You can also drag and zoom.
