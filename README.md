The easiest way to run this code is just to open in in the VS Code and use the extension "Live Server"

On the down right corner you have this icon to put it online.

and it will open a port on your machine (usually for me its 5500).

You can see the port in this icon

if it doesn't open automaticly.

On your browser you can type "http://127.0.0.1:5500/" on the url.

To interact with the project you can drag and zoom for now.

You can close the server/Vs Code instance if you wish because the files are already on ram memory in your browser. 
Just don't refresh(otherwise you will have to turn the server back on so it can provide the cliente(browser) the files).

Feel free to download it and try new values to make it more your style.
